= Toolchain installation =

  Some care has to be taken in order to use Jennics toolchain together with
the build system of Contiki. Libraries and header files provided by Jennic
have to either be copied to a compiler-known path or by setting JENSDK_PATH
prior to running make, i.e. the make call to build an application will become:

 $ make JENSDK_PATH=/path/to/jennic/sdk/installation

If you do not like to specify this on every make call, you can add that path to
your project specific Makefile.target, i.e. is enough:

 $ echo JENSDK_PATH=/path/to/jennic/sdk/installation >> Makefile.target

For example to build examples/ethbridge and program it into a jennic module
connected to your serial line using jenprog, you need to do the following:

 $ cd examples/ethbridge
 $ make TARGET=jnusb ethbridge.jnusb.hex
 $ jenprog ethbridge.jnusb.hex

= Platforms =

  Two example platforms are included in the Jennic port: jndevkit and jnusb.
The first one supports the demo board from Jennics evaluation kit. The latter is
a homegrown board with a Maxim USB controller attached, this boards enables the
use as a ethernet emulation usb stick (cdc_subset), similar to the AVR raven
board. Schematics and Board Layout are available on request.

= Wireless support =

  All Jennic chips include a ieee802.15.4 wireless controller. Support for
sicslowpan and ipv6 on top of these controllers is implemented and tested.

= Programming & Debugging =

  Reprogramming and debugging jennic chips is done via the serial line. For
reprogramming purposes you can either use jennic provided tool or if you are
working under linux you can use jenprog
(http://www.teco.edu/~scholl/jenprog-1.0.tar.gz).

  Debugging support is enabled by compiling with the DEBUG flag set:

 $ make DEBUG=true

this will start gdb stubs on the jennic chip whenever you power it up, to open
the debug shell use the following commands:

 $ ba-elf-gdb <your-program>
GNU gdb 6.6

(gdb) set ignore_MMU 1
(gdb) set remotebaud 38400
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyUSB0

Assuming that you connected you jennic through with the provided ftdi-cable
attached to /dev/ttyUSB0 and the first serial port on the jennic. Keep in mind
that debugger itself is pretty buggy.
